# 📊 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`final ppt.ipynb`) that demonstrates a **step-by-step data analysis process**.  
The main goal of this project is to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset to extract **valuable insights** using Python.  

The project is designed to:
- Perform **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers)
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize patterns and trends
- Summarize findings into clear **business insights**

## ⚙️ Workflow / Process
The project follows a structured approach:

### 1. Data Collection
- Dataset loaded into Python environment (CSV/Excel/Database).
- Initial inspection of rows, columns, and data types.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values  
- Remove duplicates  
- Fix invalid entries (negative values, typos, etc.)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summary of key features  
- Distribution of numerical variables  
- Frequency of categorical variables  

### 4. Data Visualization
- Bar plots, histograms, scatter plots  
- Time-series analysis (if applicable)  
- Country-wise, product-wise, or customer-wise patterns  

### 5. Business Insights
- Identify top-performing categories  
- Detect seasonal sales trends  
- Spot valuable customers (Pareto principle – 80/20 rule)
